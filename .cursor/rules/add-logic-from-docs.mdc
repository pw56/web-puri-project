# Add Logic From Documentation Rules

## Purpose
- Implement application logic based on the provided specification.
- Preserve the existing React component structure as much as possible.
- Inject only the minimum required state and handlers.

---

## React Structure
- Do not significantly modify the existing component hierarchy or file structure.
- Respect the current component responsibilities and avoid unnecessary merging or splitting.
- Extend the existing props flow without breaking it.

---

## State Management
- Add new state only when absolutely necessary.
- Place new state in the **lowest common ancestor** that naturally manages it.
- Avoid adding state that causes unnecessary re-renders.
- Reuse existing state whenever possible.

---

## Handlers
- Add new event handlers in a way that aligns with the existing component structure.
- Define handlers in the component that has the clearest responsibility, then pass them down via props when needed.
- Reuse or extend existing handlers when appropriate instead of creating new ones.

---

## Implementation Guidelines
- The behavior described in the specification must be implemented as the top priority.
- When the specification is ambiguous, infer behavior based on existing UI and code intentions.
- Follow the project's coding conventions (indentation, naming, prohibited patterns, etc.).

---

## AI Behavior
- Carefully read the specification and identify all required logic before implementing.
- Always prioritize extending the existing structure rather than refactoring it.
- Large-scale refactoring or abstraction should only be done when strictly necessary to satisfy the specification.
- Keep changes minimal and easy to understand.
