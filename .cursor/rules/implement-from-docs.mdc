# Implement From Documentation Rules

## Core Rule
- Implement code strictly based on the provided specification or documentation.

## Restrictions
- Do not introduce any assumptions, interpretations, or behaviors that are not explicitly stated in the documentation.
- Do not add features, logic, or flows that are not required by the specification.
- When the specification is unclear, request clarification instead of guessing.

## AI Behavior
- Always prioritize fidelity to the documentation over convenience or optimization.
- Ensure that all implemented logic directly corresponds to documented requirements.
- Avoid speculative behavior or creative interpretation unless explicitly requested.
